#  CRM Analytics Project

This project aims to perform in-depth customer analysis to support marketing and customer relationship management (CRM) strategies. It covers CLV calculation, customer segmentation using RFM, churn risk analysis, and new customer acquisition trends.

---

##  Tools Used

- **Excel**: For data cleaning and preprocessing
- **MySQL Workbench**: For building analytical tables and calculations
- **Tableau**: For creating dashboards and visualizations

---

##  Step 1: Data Cleaning (Excel)

- Removed cancelled invoices (e.g., Invoice IDs starting with 'C')
- Filtered out null or invalid `customer_id`
- Created `total_spending = quantity * price_usd` for later use in RFM and CLV calculations

---

##  Step 2: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) â€“ Next 180 Days

Calculate the estimated revenue a customer would generate over the next **180 days**, assuming past purchase behavior continues.

```sql
CREATE TABLE crm.clv_180_days AS
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        ROUND(AVG(price_usd),2) AS avg_purchase,
        COUNT(DISTINCT invoice) AS total_orders,
        DATEDIFF(MAX(invoicedate), MIN(invoicedate)) AS customer_lifespan,
        COUNT(DISTINCT invoice) * 1.0 / 
        CASE 
            WHEN DATEDIFF(MAX(invoicedate), MIN(invoicedate)) = 0 THEN 1
            ELSE DATEDIFF(MAX(invoicedate), MIN(invoicedate))
        END AS purchase_frequency_per_day
    FROM crm.online_retail_cleaned
    WHERE customer_id IS NOT NUL_
```

## Step 3: RFM Segmentation

- Segment customers using RFM analysis based on:
- Recency: How recently a customer purchased
- Frequency: How often they purchased
- Monetary: How much they spent 

```sql
CREATE TABLE crm.rfm AS
WITH rfm AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        DATEDIFF('2010-12-09', MAX(invoicedate)) AS recency_days,
        COUNT(DISTINCT invoice) AS frequency,
        SUM(total_spending) AS monetary_value
    FROM crm.online_retail_cleaned
    WHERE customer_id <> 0
    GROUP BY customer_id
),
rfm_scores AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        recency_days,
        frequency,
        monetary_value,
        CASE
            WHEN recency_days <= 30 THEN 1
            WHEN recency_days <= 90 THEN 2
            WHEN recency_days <= 180 THEN 3
            ELSE 4
        END AS recency_score,
        NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) AS frequency_score,
        NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY monetary_value DESC) AS monetary_score
    FROM rfm
)
SELECT
    customer_id,
    recency_days,
    frequency,
    monetary_value,
    CONCAT(recency_score, frequency_score, monetary_score) AS rfm_score,
    CASE 
        WHEN CONCAT(recency_score, frequency_score, monetary_score) = '111' THEN 'Best Customers'
        WHEN CONCAT(recency_score, frequency_score, monetary_score) = '311' THEN 'Almost Lost'
        WHEN CONCAT(recency_score, frequency_score, monetary_score) = '411' THEN 'Lost Customers'
        WHEN LEFT(CONCAT(recency_score, frequency_score, monetary_score),1) = '1' THEN 'Recent Customers'
        WHEN SUBSTRING(CONCAT(recency_score, frequency_score, monetary_score),2,1) = '1' THEN 'Loyal Customers'
        WHEN RIGHT(CONCAT(recency_score, frequency_score, monetary_score),1) = '1' THEN 'Big Spenders'
        ELSE 'Others'
    END AS rfm_segment
FROM rfm_scores;
```

## Step 4:Churn Risk Analysis
Classify customers by their churn risk level based on inactivity.

```sql
CREATE TABLE crm.churn_risk_level AS
SELECT
    customer_id,
    DATEDIFF('2010-12-09', MAX(invoicedate)) AS churn_day,
    CASE
        WHEN DATEDIFF('2010-12-09', MAX(invoicedate)) < 30 THEN 'Low Risk'
        WHEN DATEDIFF('2010-12-09', MAX(invoicedate)) < 60 THEN 'Medium Risk'
        WHEN DATEDIFF('2010-12-09', MAX(invoicedate)) < 90 THEN 'High Risk'
        ELSE 'Churned'
    END AS churn_risk_level
FROM crm.online_retail_cleaned
GROUP BY customer_id;
```
## Step 5:Customer Acquisition Analysis
Identify new customer trends by month and country.

```sql
WITH first_purchase AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        country,
        MIN(invoicedate) AS first_purchase_date
    FROM crm.online_retail_cleaned
    WHERE customer_id IS NOT NULL AND customer_id <> 0
    GROUP BY customer_id, country
)
SELECT
    country,
    DATE_FORMAT(first_purchase_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS new_customers
FROM first_purchase
GROUP BY country, month
ORDER BY month, country;
```
## Step 6: Visualization (Tableau)
<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1754553606784' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Country ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;RF&#47;RFMandCLV&#47;Country&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='RFMandCLV&#47;Country' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;RF&#47;RFMandCLV&#47;Country&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1754553606784');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='1277px';}                     var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>
